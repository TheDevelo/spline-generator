# Spline Generator
_Spline Generator_ is a tool for easily creating spline models for use in the Source Engine.
Simply load your map's .VMF file, create a spline, and export it.
The resulting .QC/.SMD files can be compiled using StudioMDL or [Crowbar](https://github.com/ZeqMacaw/Crowbar)

The tool can be run using:
```bash
cargo run --release
```

Additionally, a web version of the tool can be found at: https://thedevelo.github.io/spline-generator
